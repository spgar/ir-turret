## Done!

* GuessingGame
    * IRTurret-GuessingGame.ino
    * it picks a number from 1-6 when you push star. you guess what it is. p.s you get blasted if you are wrong
* RandomShootingGame
    * IRTurret-RandomShootingGame.ino
    * Push enter and there's a random chance to either nod at you (good), shake head and fire (bad), or fire all (really bad)
* Number Shooter
    * IRTurret-NumberShooter.ino
    * Push a number and it shoots that many times

## Ideas

* Push a number and it either shoots or nods that many times
* Nod n times, need to push that number or you get blasted
